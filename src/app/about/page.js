      <h1>Hello, I am CJ Eilenstine, an aspiring web developer and designer</h1>
      <p>
        My journey started with entering college and switching majors to
        something I had no clue about, Web Development. Working on websites was
        extremely interesting and inspired me to want to do my best in web
        development. I hope to do well with this career path.
